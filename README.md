# K-Means Clustering on Mall Customer Dataset

This project uses the K-Means Clustering algorithm to segment mall customers based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**.

---

## 📊 Overview

Clustering is a powerful unsupervised learning technique for finding patterns or groupings in data. In this project, we:
- Load and explore the Mall Customer dataset
- Visualize relationships between features
- Apply the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters
- Use K-Means to group customers into distinct segments
- Visualize these segments to identify marketing opportunities

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn (KMeans)
